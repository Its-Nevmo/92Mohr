# 92Mohr

Probably my largest project to date, I present the 92Mohr. It's a TKL+, as I call it, because it follows the standard 87-key tenkeyless keyboard layout plus an additional five keys above the arrow keys (which I would think would have been done before, but I guess not). Utilizing the ALPS keyswitch standard, I used Matias Quiet Click switches with KbParadise Vintage PBT keycaps. 

While the original design had an integrated microcontroller, I learned the hard way that SMD soldering is not easy if you do not have the correct tools. As such, the most recent active revision, V3, relies on a socketed microcontroller. In this case, I'm using the Elite-C, but a Pro Micro would work as well. I'm currently in the process of developing a fourth version, featuring an integrated microcontroller, universal switch sockets for people who want MX switches instead of ALPS, and possibly a rotary switch and OLED display.
